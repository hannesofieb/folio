        <p>Generally, the best ux design leaves no strain nor impression on the user — it's about creating a seamless user experience. However, I also believe that great UX design can truly captivate: creating something intuitive and visually compelling is often what makes people want to use (and keep using) a product. </p> 
        <p> With my background in UX and graphic design, I love to to blend conceptual and creative elements with practical and accessible design frameworks. This balance allows me to craft projects where functionality meets excitement—delivering intuitive and visually engaging experiences that feel both fresh and recognisable.</p>
