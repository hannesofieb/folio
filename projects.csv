We explored how to reduce consumer waste by creating a system that connects donors with NGOs, ensuring reusable items are efficiently redistributed. The project required us to apply design thinking—from user research and prototyping to usability testing and evaluation—to develop an impactful, scalable solution.","div[{H1[Drop It Off – Reducing Waste Through Smarter Donations]}{p-em[An interactive prototype designed to streamline the donation process, ensuring reusable items reach the right recipients while reducing landfill waste.]}],h3[The challenge],p[Despite many consumers wanting to donate their unwanted items responsibly, 85% of donation bin contents still end up in landfills due to sorting inefficiencies and misdirected donations. At the same time, smaller community-driven organizations and NGOs struggle to obtain necessary donations, lacking visibility and structured systems for receiving items. Businesses, though often willing to donate surplus goods, face logistical challenges that lead them to default to wasteful disposal methods.],h3[Our solution],div[{p[Drop It Off bridges this gap by creating a donation-matching system that:]}{ul.col[Connects donors with NGOs actively seeking specific items.;Improves transparency in donation distribution.;Reduces waste by redistributing reusable items more effectively.]}],h3[Impact summary],p[{ul.col[71.4 SUS Score → Above-average usability score, validating the platform’s core functionality with room for refinement.;Encouraging donor adoption through transparency → Showing where donations go helps donors emotionally connect with causes, increasing willingness to donate.;Usability challenges in scaling adoption →  Strong early engagement, but onboarding and feature discoverability need refinement for long-term adoption.;Future scalability → The NGO and business-facing interface requires further development to support inventory management and large-scale donation logistics.]}{em[*As an early-stage iteration, this design cycle has validated the platform’s usefulness.
