We explored how to reduce consumer waste by creating a system that connects donors with NGOs, ensuring reusable items are efficiently redistributed. The project required us to apply design thinking—from user research and prototyping to usability testing and evaluation—to develop an impactful, scalable solution.","div[{H1[Drop It Off – Reducing Waste Through Smarter Donations]}{p-em[An interactive prototype designed to streamline the donation process, ensuring reusable items reach the right recipients while reducing landfill waste.]}],h3[The challenge],p[Many consumers want to donate unwanted items, yet 85% of donations end up in landfills due to sorting inefficiencies. Meanwhile, smaller charities struggle to obtain necessary donations due to a lack of visibility and communication barriers.],h3[Our solution],div[{p[Drop It Off bridges this gap by creating a donation-matching system that:]}{ul[Connects donors with NGOs actively seeking specific items.;Improves transparency in donation distribution.;Reduces waste by redistributing reusable items more effectively.]}],h3[Impact summary],p[{ul[71.4 SUS Score → Above-average usability score, promising for further iterations.;Validated problem space → Addressed key paradoxes found in consumer waste systems.;Future potential → Needs more testing to refine UI and usability, but usefulness is strong.]} It is important to note however, that {em[*this is an early-stage iteration in the design cycle. Further testing is needed to refine the UI and ensure seamless adoption.*]}]","h2[Step 1: Setting up the team],h3[timeline],p[a little paragraph here.],h3[team expectations],p[what do we want to achieve, what are our strengths and weaknesses and how do we all prefer to work...],h3[meetings and minutes],p[We also figured out, {ul[what times we would be available;locations to meet up]}And we made notes and took minutes of everything so that people who couldn't show were able to catch up, and for documentation and later convenience for the report.]","h2[Establishing a situation of use],p[Addressing the paradox of consumer waste and unmet donation needs, the 'Drop it Off' platform efficiently connects consumers with various organisations in need of specific donations. The platform will help streamline the donation process to maximise the impact of surplus goods and therefore minimise consumer waste.],h3[Rich Pictures],p[Throughout the design process, our rich picture expanded],img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP0a-stakeholders-main.jpg;assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP0b-rich-picture.jpg;assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP0c-stakeholders.jpg]"
