Our team of five UX designers was tasked with identifying a real-world problem, conceptualizing a digital solution, and developing a prototype. We conducted user research, usability testing, and iterative design evaluations to refine our solution.","div[{H1[Drop It Off]}{p-em[What if donating was as easy as throwing something away?
