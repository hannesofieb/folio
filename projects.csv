Our team of five UX designers was tasked with identifying a real-world problem, conceptualizing a digital solution, and developing a prototype. We conducted user research, usability testing, and iterative design evaluations to refine our solution.","div[{H1[Drop It Off]}{p-em[What if donating was as easy as throwing something away? Drop It Off makes donating an effortless experience by connecting unwanted items with people who actually need them—reducing landfill waste in the process.]}],h3[The challenge],p[In a culture of constant consumption, people frequently discard unwanted items—but without clear donation guidelines, many default to landfill disposal or indiscriminately dump everything in donation bins, leading to overflow and wasted items at large charities. At the same time, smaller NGOs struggle with visibility and lack a structured way to communicate when and what they can accept. Without a system to streamline donations, valuable resources go to waste, and organisations miss out on essential support.],h3[Our solution],div[{p[Drop It Off bridges this gap by creating a donation-matching system that:]}{ul.col[Matches donors with NGOs actively seeking specific items through a filterable map.;Guides users with an AI-powered photo-scan that determines whether an item is fit for donation.;Increases visibility for smaller NGOs, helping donors find causes that align with their values.]}{p[These are all key functions of the app that helps diverting reusable items from landfills by making the donation process an effortless experience and seamless as disposal.]}],h3[Impact summary],div[{ul.col[71.4 SUS Score → Above-average usability score, validating the platform’s core functionality with room for refinement.;Usability challenges in scaling adoption →  Strong early engagement, but onboarding and feature discoverability need refinement for long-term adoption.;Future scalability → The NGO and business-facing interface requires further development to support inventory management and large-scale donation logistics.]}{p-em[*As an early-stage iteration, this design cycle has validated the platform’s usefulness.
