Our team was tasked with identifying a real-world problem, conceptualizing a digital solution, and developing a prototype. We conducted user research, usability testing, and iterative design evaluations to refine our solution.","div[{H1[Drop It Off]}{p-em[What if donating was as easy as throwing something away? Drop It Off makes donating an effortless experience by connecting unwanted items with people who actually need them—reducing landfill waste in the process.]}],h3[The challenge],p[In a culture of constant consumption, people frequently discard unwanted items—but without clear donation guidelines, many default to landfill disposal or indiscriminately dump everything in donation bins, leading to overflow and wasted items at large charities. At the same time, smaller NGOs struggle with visibility and lack a structured way to communicate when and what they can accept. Without a system to streamline donations, valuable resources go to waste, and organisations miss out on essential support.],h3[Our solution],div[{p[Drop It Off bridges this gap by creating a donation-matching system that:]}{ul.col[Matches donors with NGOs actively seeking specific items through a filterable map.;Guides users with an AI-powered photo-scan that determines whether an item is fit for donation.;Increases visibility for smaller NGOs, helping donors find causes that align with their values.]}{p[These are all key functions of the app that helps diverting reusable items from landfills by making the donation process an effortless experience and seamless as disposal.]}],h3[Impact summary],div[{ul.col[71.4 SUS Score → Above-average usability score, validating the platform’s core functionality with room for refinement.;Encouraging donor adoption through transparency → Showing where donations go helps donors emotionally connect with causes, increasing willingness to donate.;Usability challenges in scaling adoption →  Strong early engagement, but onboarding and feature discoverability need refinement for long-term adoption.;Future scalability → The NGO and business-facing interface requires further development to support inventory management and large-scale donation logistics.]}{p-em[*As an early-stage iteration, this design cycle has validated the platform’s usefulness. However, further UI refinement and testing are needed to ensure a frictionless user experience and maximize long-term impact.]}]","h2[Research & Discovery],div[{p[We first identified consumer waste as our situation of use, focusing on why donations were being misdirected or discarded. To map out key influences in this ecosystem, we established five main stakeholder groups:]}{ul.col[Consumers: Individuals trying to donate items or discard them.;Charity Workers & NGOs: Organisations managing donations but facing logistical challenges.;People in Need: Beneficiaries reliant on donations for essential items.;Circular Economy Services: Platforms facilitating second-hand sales and exchanges.;Retail Industry: Businesses generating surplus items with potential for donation.]}{p[To ensure high usefulness, we conducted interviews with representatives across three of these groups, using their insights to refine our assumptions and identify critical pain points.]}],div.multi-carousel[{img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP0a-stakeholders-main.jpg{main stakeholders in the situation of consumer waste;The initial rich picture, captioning the main stakeholders: consumers, retail industry (consumer industry), charity workers, people in need, and circular economy services.}]}{img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP0b-rich-picture.jpg{rich picture;Initial rich picture with assumptions of the stakeholders’ needs and wants with annotated complimentary— and clashing statements (red and green lines).}]}{img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP0c-stakeholders.jpg{nuanced map of stakeholders;A more nuanced map of all the stakeholders, with annotations on who we interviewed.}]{more nuanced representations of stakeholders;}}{img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP2-rich-picture.png{detailed, final rich picture;Detailed rich picture with overview of stakeholders’ presumed and observed wants and needs with annotated complimentary and clashing statements.}]}]","Div[{h2[Initial Ideation and Prototyping]}{p[After identifying the stakeholders clashing and complimenting wants and pain points, each team member developed concepts to address specific paradoxes in the donation system.]}{p[These concepts got evaluated on their usefulness by 5 different stakeholders, and based on these new insights, we decided to merge three of them: The donation platform, an AI item scanner, and an information channel on sustainably riddance of items.]}{img.solo[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/ideation.png{initial ideation prototypes;Low fidelity prototypes of different ideas: Donation Platform (far left), AI item scanner (top centre), Donation pickup/delivery (bottom centre), and an information channel (far right).}]}],div[{h3[The Donation Platform]}{p[Businesses and consumers seek a fast, effortless way to donate, but slow communication and processing at donation centers cause delays and lost contributions. Without structured intake systems, valuable items are discarded instead of reaching those in need.]}{p[The platform streamlines this process by matching donations to centers actively seeking them with a minimalistic filter by category system. Users tick off what they want to donate, which instantly updates the map—and list view to show nearby drop-off locations.]}],div.small-gallery[{img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP3-design-ideas01.png{donation platform low fidelity prototype}]}{img[assets/proj/dropitoff/methods/STEP3-design-ideas012.png{donation platform low fidelity prototype}]}],div[{h3[The AI Scanner]}{p[Donors want a fast way to give away items but often struggle to determine what’s donation-worthy, while donation centers face an influx of unsuitable goods, slowing processing.]}{p[The AI Scanner solves this by instantly assessing items through image recognition, guiding users on whether to donate, recycle, or dispose.
